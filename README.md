# static-project-generator
Super simple static html/scss/js project generatorin bash

The actual file to reference (`project_static.sh`) is what you will call in your terminal. Feel free to rename that.

Download and place somewhere easy to navigate to, especially in your terminal (I use `~/scripts/`)


Then cd into your new project directory:

``cd /Users/username/Documents/Projects/my-cool-project``


Then run the generator file based on the location you put it:

``~/scripts/project_static.sh``


You will be promted to npm install some gulp packages from the generated package.json:

``Scaffolding done...do you want to npm install (y/n)?``

If you want to, type `y` for yes, otherwise `n` for no and hit return.


Happy coding!
